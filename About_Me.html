      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm <b>Hafizal!</b> I am currently a <i>Year 2.2 Dip. in Accountancy & Finance student.</i>
        Outside of studies, I enjoy doing photography and I play the guitar (amatuer level though) during my free time.
        However, if you ask me IT-related stuff like coding or debugging,
        I will probably stare at the screen and blank out...</p>
      <p> So I have decided to take this opportunity in Guided Learning
        to learn a new skill. This portfolio site that I have coded from scratch, will showcase my journey from zero
        knowledge to
        creating this website you are currently viewing! </p>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
      <h3>What is Guided Learning?</h3>
      <p>Guided Learning is an elective subject where students can take control of their own learning in an area
        they're interested in. Students will explore topics that build on what they already know or help them learn
        something new.</p>
        
      <p>They'll plan and carry out their own learning project with guidance, working step by step
        beyond the usual classroom setting. In the end, they'll create a portfolio that shows what they've learned
        and how they've grown. All of this would be carried out under the Plan-Perform-Monitor-Reflect process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
      <h3>What project am I doing?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Web development basics</li>
        <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
        <p>My project focuses on learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through Guided Learning. The main goal of this project is to understand how websites are 
          structured, styled, and made interactive, even though I do not come from an IT background.

<h3>Why am I doing this project?</h3>
<p>Website building has become increasingly common in today’s digital world, and many businesses rely heavily on online platforms to communicate with customers. 
  As an Accountancy & Finance student, I felt that picking up a technical hard skill like basic web development would 
  complement and broaden my overall skill set. This project also allows me to step out of my comfort zone 
  and explore an area that I am less familiar with, especially since IT-related topics are not my strongest area.</p>

<h3>How will I carry out this project?</h3>
<p>I will start by learning the fundamentals of HTML to build the structure of a website, 
  followed by CSS to style and improve its visual appearance. After that, I will explore basic JavaScript to add simple interactivity and functionality. 
  Throughout the project, I will apply what I learn by creating a simple website and gradually improving it as I gain more understanding. </p>
