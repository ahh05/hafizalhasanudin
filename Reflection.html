        <p>Overall, my Guided Learning journey pushed me out of my comfort zone as I had no 
          prior experience in coding or
        website development. I started by learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
        through online platforms such
        as LinkedIn Learning, and applied what I learnt through hands-on practice and mini 
        projects like the Terrarium
        and Calculator.</p>
        
        <p>Along the way, I faced challenges such as debugging errors and balancing my time with other
        academic commitments, especially during busy periods in the semester. However, these challenges helped me
        develop resilience, adaptability, and better time management. By the end of the project, I was able to
        independently build and refine my own portfolio website, which gave me greater confidence as a self-directed
        learner and showed how much I had progressed from the start of my Guided Learning journey.</l>

        <h3>Plan: Weeks 1 & 2</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I focused on planning and preparation for my learning project, as I had no prior experience in coding or
            website-building.</li>
          <li>I then had the first consultation with Ms Hu, and she advised me on the appropriate sites to use such as
            finding
            a suitable course on LinkedIn Learning.</li>
          <li>I researched suitable online coding tutorials and finalised the platforms I would be using, mainly
            LinkedIn
            Learning, alongside sites like W3Schools for specific codes assistance, and forums like StackOverflow for
            solutions</li>
          <li>I installed essential tools such as Visual Studio Code and set up the necessary programming environment on
            GitHub.</li>
          <li>I refined my Student-Initiated Learning Project Proposal, clarified doubts with my learning facilitator,
            and
            finalised my learning plan and action timeline.</li>
          <li>I also began learning basic HTML, which marked my first hands-on exposure to coding.</li>
          <li><i>There was a lot of stuff happening as the semester had just started. I realised that a good handling of
              time management goes a long way and helps to plan out my tasks to be done, rather than completing it at
              the
              last minute. </i></li>

        <h3>Perform: Weeks 3 & 4</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I focused on making steady progress in HTML and understanding how webpages are structured.</li>
          <li>I learnt how to use basic HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links to create simple
            webpages.</li>
          <li>Once I've completed the HTML modules of the course, I started out with the CSS modules.</li>
          <li><i>I felt motivated at this point to learn the basics of HTML and to set-up a simple Visual Studio Code
              environment. It was satisfying to accomplish the first milestone of the project.</i></li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <h3>Perform: Weeks 5 & 6</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I continued working on CSS and began experimenting with different design elements.</li>
          <li>I applied colours, spacing, font styles, and layout techniques to improve the overall look and
            readability of my webpages.</li>
          <li>I also started working on a Google Sites page to map out the sections that my final website would
            contain, in preparation for the upcoming consultation.</li>
          <li><i>Throughout the two weeks, I was able to complete the tasks as stated in the Learning Contract. However,
              as the semester progressed and other projects emerge, I knew that I would have to juggle between that and
              Guided Learning well. </i></li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <h3>Perform: Weeks 7 & 8</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>From the second consultation with Ms Hu, I had shown her my current progress on HTML and CSS. And
            demonstrated the current project of the Terrarium mini project. </li>
          <li>I focused mainly on JavaScript, learning how to handle user interactions and basic logic. Specifically
            adding animation to the page when loading, and dragging element of a defined item id. </li>
          <li>The first mini project of the Terrarium was formally done.</li>
          <li>I then created a separate respository to test out and play around with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            codes to explore more on the terrarium and the expected results if I tweaked certain codes around.</li>
          <li>That respository would also be the final E-Portfolio site to host my codes.</li>
          <li><i>The feeling of accomplishment hit me as I completed the HTML and CSS modules of the LinkedIn Learning
              course. However, it was also draining as despite a video walkthrough being available, I still faced issues
              with my
              codes that slowed my progress at times. Specifically not linking my CSS file under the same folder as the
              HTML files. It was a silly mistake but I managed to learn and remember it quickly.</i></li>
        </ul>
      </div>


      <div class="column">
        <h3>Monitor: Weeks 9 & 10</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Weeks 9 and 10 coincided with the term test and term break, so progress was lighter (and I must admit, I
            did
            not make much progress as I had to focus on my MST).</li>
          <li>However, once my MST had ended, I reflected on my learning progress and prepare mentally for the final
            stages of the project as it would involve of a online research (e.g. Experimenting with different CSS codes
            from
            W3Schools and StackOverflow for different layouts of the top nav for example).</li>
          <li>I also thought of proceeding with another mini project to deepen my understanding on JavaScript.
            Eventually,
            I decided on making a calculator that can function with an input and output.</li>
          <li><i>Although I did not make much progress during these two weeks, I felt that the break was necessary to
              recharge and prepare myself for the final push towards completing my e-portfolio website. I was determined
              to make significant progress in the upcoming weeks.</i></li>
        </ul>
      </div>


      <div class="column">
        <h3>Monitor: Weeks 11 & 12</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I focused on finalising the draft website and transitioning into building the final version.</li>
          <li>I refined the website structure, improved navigation, and ensured consistency in design across all pages.
          </li>
          <li>I looked up several sites to look for a suitable colour scheme for my final site. I then decided to go
            ahead
            with a minimalist scheme of grey, black and white.</li>
          <li>I ensured that all pages were functional, visually consistent, and easy to navigate. Particularly adding
            the
            hyperlinks on the top nav and on the individual HTML pages to navigate.</li>
          <li>Photos and video recordings to showcase my progress were also compiled and uploading onto VSC for the
            initial code, and onto GitHub Repository for the final website.</li>
          <li><i>During these weeks, I felt a mix of excitement and pressure as I worked to finalise my website. There
              were moments of frustration when things didn't work as expected, but overcoming those challenges made the
              process rewarding. I was proud of the progress I had made and eager to see the final product come
              together.</i></li>

        <h3>Reflect: Weeks 13 & 14</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Concentrated on completing the final website and curating my portfolio content.</li>
          <li>Had the third consultation and showed Ms Hu my final website. Most of my pages followed through the rubris
            apart from my reflection that was not done.</li>
          <li>After finalising and completing my final website, I had the last consultation (TO ADD ON)</li>
          <li><i>In these final weeks, I felt a sense of satisfaction as I wrapped up my project. There was a lot of
              attention to detail required to ensure everything was polished and professional. I learnt the importance
              of
              resilience and adaptability, as I had to make last-minute adjustments and improvements. Even up till
              learning on inserting a PDF as that required a separate folder "pdfs". Overall, it was a fulfilling
              experience that enhanced my skills and confidence in web development.</i></li>
