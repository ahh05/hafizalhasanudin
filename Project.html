      <h3>Mini Project #1: <a href="Terrarium.html"><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Terrarium</a></h3>
      <p>For this project, I followed a <a
          href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=76881922&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fhtml-css-and-javascript-building-the-web%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DRLhUbP4ASDWsH%252Foqx%252FVuUw%253D%253D"
          target="_blank">LinkedIn Learning Course</a>
        to guide me through creating a digital project page for a terrarium.
      <p>1. Using HTML, I created the basic layout of the page by adding headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
        This step was important because it formed the foundation of the website and ensured that all content was
        organised and easy to understand.</p>
      <p>2. Next, I applied **CSS** to style the webpage and improve its visual appearance. I experimented with
        different colours, font styles,
        rounded corners, spacing, and layout positioning to make the page look cleaner and more visually appealing.
        CSS also allowed me to
        maintain consistency across different sections of the website.</p>
      <p>3. Finally, I explored **basic JavaScript** to add interactivity to the webpage. I used JavaScript to
        create simple hover effects
        and animations for the project images, making the page more engaging for users. This step helped me
        understand how JavaScript improves
        user interaction beyond static content. </p>

      <h3>Mini Project #2: <a href="Calculator.html"><i class="fas fa-calculator"></i> Calculator</a></h3>
      <p>For this project, I followed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHkN82X3KNU&t=14s"
          target="_blank">YouTube Video Walkthrough</a>
        to create a functional web calculator. While I applied HTML to build the structure and CSS for styling,
        the main focus of this project was to learn JavaScript's functionality.
        I used JavaScript to make the calculator interactive. Particularly handling number input, performing
        arithmetic operations, updating the display dynamically, and managing user interactions like clearing or
        deleting input.</p>
      <p>1. I started by using HTML to structure the calculator. This involved creating the layout of the
        calculator such as the display area and the buttons for numbers, operators, and functions such as clear and
        delete.
        By organising these elements properly, I was able to create a clear and user-friendly interface for the
        calculator.</p>
      <p>2. Next, I applied CSS to style the calculator and improve its visual appearance. I used colours, spacing,
        rounded corners,
        and alignment to make the calculator look neat and modern. CSS also helped me ensure that the buttons were
        evenly spaced
        and easy to click, which improved the overall user experience.</p>
      <p>3. Finally, I used JavaScript to make the calculator interactive and functional. I learned how to capture user
        input when
        buttons were clicked and store the values using variables. JavaScript allowed me to perform arithmetic
        operations such as
        addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user’s input. I also used JavaScript to update
        the calculator display
        dynamically, so that the results appeared instantly. In addition, I handled user actions like clearing the
        entire input or
        deleting the last number, which helped me better understand how JavaScript controls user interactions on a
        webpage.</p>

      <h3>Final Project: Portfolio Website</h3>
      <p>For my final project, I developed a personal portfolio website to showcase my learning journey, projects, and
        reflections throughout the course. This project allowed me to apply the web development fundamentals I had
        learnt and brought everything together into a single, functional website.
      </p>
      <p>1. I used Visual Studio Code as my main development environment to write and edit my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        files. This helped me organise my code efficiently and test changes quickly during the development process. To
        manage my project files and track updates, I used a GitHub repository, which introduced me to basic version
        control and the importance of maintaining organised project documentation.
      </p>
      <p>2. The website was then hosted using GitHub Pages, allowing it to be accessed publicly online. This step helped
        me understand how websites are deployed and how code written locally can be published for anyone with the link
        on the internet to view and use the site. Throughout the project, I focused on creating a clean layout,
        consistent design, and intuitive navigation to ensure a good user experience.</p>
      <p>Overall, this final project strengthened my understanding of web development basics, including HTML for
        structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. It also improved my project management skills,
        debugging skill as I had to plan the website structure, manage multiple pages, solve issues where the css codes
        and html codes weren't linked and ensure that all components worked together smoothly.</p>
